# terminal-football

The idea of this project was to solve a problem using other programming languages instead of the ones initially used: JavaScript and Python.

The problem was to make the stages of a football competition, group stage. The best in the group stage qualifies for the final. If there is a draw in the final, we go to penalties and then we have our champion.

If you want to know how was the process of redoing the project in Python, please access the article "Terminal football" on [Medium](https://medium.com/@oliveirajv/terminal-football-90dfa47e6b87)
