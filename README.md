# terminal-football

The idea of this project is to solve the same problem in other programming languages that was initially done in JavaScript and later in Python.

The problem is to make the stages of a football competition, group stage, the best in the group stage qualify for the final, if there is a tie in the final we go to penalties and then we have our champion.

If you want to know how was the process of redoing the project in Python, access the article Terminal football on [Medium](https://medium.com/@oliveirajv/terminal-football-90dfa47e6b87)
